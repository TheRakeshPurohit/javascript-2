# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to write floating point literals.
- Know their underlying type (double precision).
- Know their basic limitations (not all numbers can be represented, e.g. `0.1 + 0.2`).
- Know how to truncate floating point numbers to a certain decimal place (`Math.ceil`, `Math.floor`, `Math.round`)

## Out of scope

- Parsing integers and floats from strings.
- Converting integers and floats to strings.

## Concepts

- `numbers`

## Prerequisites

- `basics`
